- Keep the exported product in mfg.build/products and put a timestamp. This can help Giulio to use an older version if a newer version has a regression.
- A context menu to open selection as a file in a text editor. Useful to open log-error files.
- Build external dependencies.
- Incremental build of MFG.
- Go to the SystemTry and notify when there is a new MFG source.
